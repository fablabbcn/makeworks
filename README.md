- If a company is in no region, it will be visible.
- If the company is not verified, it will be hidden.

## Users and permissions

What can each user do:

### Admins
- Can access /admin dashboard
- Edit everything

### Champion
- Can edit everything in their Region
- Champion is a user but belongs_to Region with a `is_champion` flag

### Normal user (logged in)
- Submit a new (unverified) company

### Not logged in user
- Only view most items

### Company Employee roles
Company owner can edit his company and invite other users into the company

When a user creates a company, he becomes an employee and the owner.

There are 3 roles:
- Owners: can edit everything and give other employees access.
- Managers: can edit but not add new employees.
- Normal: nothing?


To become a 'champion' an admin needs to make you one, via the https://new.make.works/admin/user_regions interface.

Edit manufacturering tags in a not verified listing as an admin by deleting /admin/ out of listing URL to enter front end editor.
