<p>
Our distributed Make Works team collects in-depth, practical information including turnaround times, minimum order costs and previous clients to verify and list skilled local manufacturers. We do this to provide the best possible information for those who want to make. We encourage you to evaluate, based on the information provided, whether that manufacturer is right for your product or project before you get in touch. We are committed to making sure that this information is open, accurate and up to date.

  Contacting the manufacturer
</h2>

<p>
Using Make Works means that you can get in touch with a manufacturer directly.
</p>

<p>
We know it can feel a bit intimidating when you first get in touch with a new manufacturer, especially if it is in an industry you haven't worked with before.
</p>


<p>
On each listing, we've included our recommended contact along with a photo so that you can even put a face to a name! You can then use the contact information provided to start a conversation with manufacturers about your project. In our experience, manufacturers who are unable to assist with specific projects will often generously signpost enquirers to those they believe can help you with your research and building your networks.

Best practices for approaching local manufacturers

  </li>
  <li>
    Do your research. Read the production specifics and details about each company, and watch their video before contacting them. If you get in touch with someone who explicitly states that they do not do what you are looking to do,  so as not to unnecessarily you are only wasting your or their time as well as your own.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be clear and specific about what you are looking for. Even if you are just at the idea stage, make sure you explain in as much detail as possible what your project is, what you are looking for and any expectations you have about budget, time, materials or other.
